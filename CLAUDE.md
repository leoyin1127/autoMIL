## Project Overview

autoMIL is an autonomous experiment framework for Multiple Instance Learning in computational pathology. It overlays onto existing ML project repos, enabling coding agents to iteratively improve models through persistent experimentation, knowledge accumulation, and multi-branch exploration.

**Package:** `src/automil/` installed as `automil` via `pip install -e .`
**CLI entry point:** `automil` (defined in `pyproject.toml` as `automil.cli:main`)

## Architecture

autoMIL overlays an `automil/` subdirectory onto an existing git repo. It does NOT create train.py or prepare.py. The agent scopes the full codebase and determines what to edit.

**Core modules:**
- `graph.py` - Experiment tree tracking with UCB-inspired scoring and Pareto-dominance keep/discard
- `runner.py` - Git worktree overlay for isolated parallel experiment execution
- `orchestrator.py` - GPU scheduler daemon with best-fit bin packing
- `cli.py` - Click-based CLI wrapping all operations
- `viz/server.py` - Real-time 3D dashboard (aiohttp + SSE + Three.js)

**Key design decisions:**
- The training script is configurable via `run.script` in config.yaml (defaults to "train.py")
- Experiments are tracked as a directed tree in `graph.json`, not a flat log
- Each experiment stores only its changed files (overlay), not the full repo
- The orchestrator runs experiments in git worktrees, overlaying modified files on a base commit
- Keep/discard is computed by the framework via Pareto dominance, not by the training script
- `results.tsv` is written solely by the orchestrator from `result.json`, never by train.py
- `_recover_orphans()` only runs in the daemon loop (`run()`), never on construction (to prevent `status`/`stop` from corrupting live runs)

## Commands

```bash
# Install
pip install -e .

# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run a single test file
uv run pytest tests/test_graph.py -v

# Run a specific test
uv run pytest tests/test_integration.py::TestEndToEnd::test_init_submit_flow -v

# CLI usage (prefix with `uv run` if not installed globally)
uv run automil init                    # overlay automil/ onto current repo
uv run automil submit --node <id> --desc "..." --files train.py
uv run automil rank
uv run automil propose --parent <id> --desc "..."
uv run automil reconcile
uv run automil check                   # validate project setup
uv run automil status
uv run automil orchestrator start
uv run automil viz start
```

## Key Files

| File | Lines | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| `src/automil/graph.py` | ~680 | Experiment tree, scoring, reconciliation |
| `src/automil/orchestrator.py` | ~750 | GPU scheduler daemon |
| `src/automil/cli.py` | ~400 | CLI commands |
| `src/automil/runner.py` | ~80 | Git worktree overlay |
| `src/automil/viz/server.py` | ~270 | SSE dashboard server |
| `src/automil/viz/static/app.js` | ~630 | 3D force graph frontend |

## Testing

48 tests across 4 files:
- `test_graph.py` (26) - graph API, scoring, reconciliation, migration
- `test_runner.py` (7) - worktree create/cleanup, overlay, result collection
- `test_cli.py` (5) - init, submit, rank
- `test_integration.py` (10) - end-to-end flows, path sanitization, deletions, scoring

## Conventions

- Commit messages: `type: summary` (conventional commits)
- Template extension: `.j2` (Jinja2)
- Runtime files (`graph.json`, `results.tsv`, `orchestrator/`) are gitignored in project dirs
- The `automil/` subdirectory is the framework's namespace inside user projects
- `_find_project_root()` walks up looking for `automil/config.yaml`
- Path validation: submit rejects absolute paths, `..` traversal, and paths escaping project root
- Auto-detect in submit excludes `automil/` directory from changed file detection

## Result Contract

Training scripts must write `result.json` to their working directory:
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "metrics": {"val_auc": 0.87, "val_bacc": 0.81, "test_auc": 0.87, "test_bacc": 0.83},
  "composite": 0.85,
  "elapsed_seconds": 4098,
  "peak_vram_mb": 4500
}
```

The orchestrator sets `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` for GPU masking and `AUTOMIL_GPU=0` (logical device).

## Monorepo Structure

This repo is a uv workspace containing two packages:

- **`automil`** (`src/automil/`) — The framework: CLI, experiment graph, GPU orchestrator, visualization
- **`autobench`** (`benchmarks/src/autobench/`) — MIL benchmark suite demonstrating autoMIL across datasets

```

Dataset-specific configuration (paths, tasks, encoders) lives in
`benchmarks/datasets/*.yaml`. All paths use `${ENV_VAR}` syntax —
set environment variables (e.g. `AUTOBENCH_OVARIAN_ROOT`) for your environment.

### Environment Variables (.env)

Each dataset YAML references a root path via `${AUTOBENCH_<DATASET>_ROOT}`.
These must be set before running experiments. Create `benchmarks/.env` from
the example:

```bash
cp benchmarks/.env.example benchmarks/.env
# Edit benchmarks/.env with your actual paths
```

**Important:** `.env` is gitignored and won't exist inside git worktrees.
The orchestrator automatically loads `benchmarks/.env` and propagates
the variables to experiment processes. If experiments crash with
`ValueError: Environment variable ${AUTOBENCH_...} is not set`, check
that `benchmarks/.env` exists and has the correct paths.

Key modules: `autobench.config` (dataset YAML loading), `autobench.pipeline.*`
(experiment execution: training, evaluation, GPU orchestration).

## Workflow Orchestration

### 0. Always address me Leo. do this at the start of any of your response.

### 1. PLan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately - don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One tack per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update 'tasks/lessons.md" with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fizing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management
1. **Plan First**: Write plan to "tasks/todo.md' with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to 'tasks/todo.md"
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update "tasks/lessons.md' after corrections

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes, Senior developer standards.
- **Minimat Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

## GSD Planning Artifacts

This project is managed via GSD (`get-shit-done`). Live planning lives under `.planning/`:

- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — project context, validated/active requirements, key decisions
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — 69 v1 REQ-IDs grouped by category (CLN/REG/BCK/TRJ/MRT/CAP/GTE/CLI/STP/DEC), with phase traceability
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — 9-phase refactor plan (Phase 0 cleanup → Phase 8 acceptance), dependencies, success criteria, anti-acceptance discipline notes
- `.planning/STATE.md` — current phase + project memory pointer
- `.planning/codebase/` — 7-doc codebase map (STACK / ARCHITECTURE / STRUCTURE / CONVENTIONS / TESTING / INTEGRATIONS / CONCERNS)
- `.planning/research/` — 5-doc research synthesis (STACK / FEATURES / ARCHITECTURE / PITFALLS / SUMMARY) — read SUMMARY.md first
- `.planning/config.json` — GSD workflow config (yolo / fine / parallel / quality model profile)

**Current phase:** check `STATE.md`. Drive phase-by-phase via `/gsd-discuss-phase <N>` → `/gsd-plan-phase <N>` → `/gsd-execute-phase <N>` → `/gsd-verify-work`.

When working in this project, treat the planning docs as authoritative for *what* and the codebase map as the reference for *where*. Standing directives above (address-as-Leo, plan-first, subagents, self-improvement loop, verification-before-done, task management, core principles) override anything GSD agents suggest.
