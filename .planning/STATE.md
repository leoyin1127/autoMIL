# State: autoMIL - F2-readiness framework refactor

## Project Reference

**Project:** autoMIL -- F2-readiness framework refactor
**Core Value:** An agent can autonomously discover model improvements for any user's training code under a 6-hour-per-cell budget, with discovered variants reproducible, attributable to their parents, and portable across machines and LLM runtimes.

**Canonical documents** (load these before any phase work):

- `.planning/PROJECT.md` -- milestone definition, validated/active/out-of-scope sets, constraints, key decisions
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` -- 69 v1 REQ-IDs across 10 categories (CLN, REG, BCK, TRJ, MRT, CAP, GTE, CLI, STP, DEC) with traceability table
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` -- 9 phases, success criteria, dependency graph, parallel-execution candidates
- `.planning/codebase/` -- existing system map (ARCHITECTURE.md, CONCERNS.md, STACK.md). Do NOT re-document.
- `.planning/research/{SUMMARY,STACK,FEATURES,ARCHITECTURE,PITFALLS}.md` -- research synthesis informing phase design
- `tasks/automil_qa.md`, `tasks/automil_proposal.md` -- design-gap diagnostic + F2 proposal that motivated this milestone
- `CLAUDE.md` -- project instructions and Leo's standing directives
- `~/.claude/projects/-home-jma-Documents-yinshuol-autoMIL/memory/MEMORY.md` -- Leo's standing memory (saturate GPUs, research before submit, never blind-checkout, architectural-not-hyperparam, never ask continue autonomously)

**Current focus:** Phase 08 -- Decoupling completion + acceptance (COMPLETE; milestone v1.0 complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 08 (decoupling-completion-acceptance) , COMPLETE
Plan: 10 of 10

- **Phase:** 08 , Decoupling completion + final acceptance
- **Plans:** 10 across 4 waves shipped
- **Status:** v1.0 milestone complete
- **Wave execution:** W1 (08-01 || 08-02 || 08-03) -> W2 (08-04 || 08-05) -> W3 (08-06 || 08-07 || 08-08) -> W4 (08-09 -> 08-10)
- **Progress (milestone):** [##########] 100% (9/9 phases shipped)
- **Next:** `/gsd-verify-work 8` -> tag v1.0.0

## Phase 8 follow-ups (deferred , not Phase 8 blockers)

1. **Sub-gate C (composability) workstation completion**: D-205 sub-gate C is a pytest.skip() in CI; the workstation-side body requires Leo's autobench + sklearn-iris co-registered project layout. Run manually on workstation; commit the active body when shape is stable.
2. **Schema version bump for graph.json**: D-200 changes storage shape but did NOT bump schema_version. Optional one-shot migration helper in graph.py:_load detecting v1 and dict-spreading existing nodes' val_auc/etc on read. Cost: ~30 lines; benefit: pre-D-200 graph.json files round-trip cleanly. Defer to v1.1 unless Leo encounters silent KeyError on legacy graph.json files.
3. **results.tsv schema generalization**: per OQ-8, the results.tsv writer keeps autobench-shaped 4-key columns (val_auc/val_bacc/test_auc/test_bacc). Sklearn-iris consumers write 0.0 for these columns (correct: no auc to record). Generalize when a third consumer surfaces that needs different display columns.
4. **viz dashboard generic-metric rendering**: per CONTEXT D-200 deferred, the viz metricFields array stays autobench-shaped. Auto-detect available keys from node.metrics and render dynamic sparklines for any consumer's metric set. Defer to post-v1.
5. **Allowlist anchor neighbor cleanup**: per F-13 LOW finding, `_orchestrator_daemon.py` lines 45-55 contain em-dashes in neighboring comments to the allowlist anchor at line 54. Future re-flow could break the anchor; low-priority cleanup for v1.1.

## Phase 6 follow-ups (deferred , not Phase 6 blockers)

1. **Pre-existing tick_cells failures** (3 tests in `tests/test_tick_cells.py`): `test_tick_cells_active_to_refusing_new`, `test_tick_cells_terminating_fires_cancel_with_cap_reason`, `test_tick_cells_finalized_when_running_empty`. Origin: Phase 4 `_orchestrator_daemon.py:_tick_cells` -- the test mocks expect `cells_dir = tmp_path / "automil" / "cells"` but the daemon's actual cells directory resolution may have shifted. Pre-existing at start of Phase 6 session (verified via `git checkout cca0bc0 -- src/automil/backends/_orchestrator_daemon.py` bisection). Not caused by namespace migration. Recommended fix: either (a) Phase 8 cleanup audits Phase 4 wiring, or (b) Leo runs targeted `/gsd-debug` on these 3 specific tests.

2. **Real-cluster verification (BCK-05/06 success criterion 5)**: D-180/D-181 deferred. CCRCC `node_0176`-equivalent end-to-end on a real SLURM cluster + multi-node Ray cluster. Behind `@pytest.mark.requires_slurm`/`requires_ray` markers in `test_contract_real_slurm.py` / `test_contract_real_ray.py` -- runs nightly only, not CI.

## Phase 5 Leo Follow-up (deferred , not a blocker for Phase 6)

The calibration pilot (D-151, Plan 05-12) framework-side scaffold is committed at `90011e8`. The actual empirical K-threshold determination requires Leo to:

1. Choose a known-good change (recommended: CCRCC `node_0176` config applied to fresh cells).
2. Pick 3-5 fresh cells (3 CCRCC + 2 CLWD per recommendation).
3. Register a calibration manifest, submit, run `automil promote --calibrate <candidate_id>`.
4. Inspect the delta matrix in `archive/<candidate_id>/gate_evaluation.jsonl` and pick K such that the change passes consistently.
5. Update `.planning/phase-05-calibration.md` with chosen K and rationale; commit.

**Phase 08 prior session log:** `/gsd-discuss-phase 8` (CONTEXT bootstrapped, 37 engineering decisions D-199..D-208), `/gsd-plan-phase 8` (10 plans across 4 waves), plan-checker iter-1 + iter-2 PASS. Wave 1 (08-01/02/03 parallel): result schema, dict-spread, sklearn-iris consumer. Wave 2 (08-04/05 parallel): env.required check + passthrough, autobench purge. Wave 3 (08-06/07/08 parallel): contract doc, docs-exist test, framework purity test. Wave 4 sequential: 08-09 (final acceptance gate) -> 08-10 (D-208 aggregator + CHANGELOG + milestone close).

**Resume file:** None

**To resume in a fresh session:** milestone v1.0 is complete. No active phase work. Run `/gsd-verify-work 8` for final verification, then tag v1.0.0.
