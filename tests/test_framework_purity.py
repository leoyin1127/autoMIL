"""DEC-01 / D-206: framework purity grep gate.

Asserts src/automil/ contains zero autobench/AUTOBENCH_/benchmarks/ references
outside the hardcoded allowlist of informational comments and known-default
operator-facing help strings. Future commits that accidentally re-introduce a
leak break this test with a named offender.

The allowlist uses content-anchor substrings (not just file:line) so line drift
within an allowlisted file fails loudly: the line check fails, the substring
check then fires on the new line, and the offender is named in the failure
message with a clear "update allowlist" instruction.

F-01 fix (Iter-2 plan-check): revert_baseline.py:87 has a ClickException with
'benchmarks/lib/CLAM/**' as an example value for registry.protected default
help text. That string is operator-facing help, not a code path; allowlisted
by intent.

Allowlist deviations from plan baseline (3 expected -> 5 actual, post-08-04/08-05):
  - config.yaml.j2:105: migration-note comment for autobench-shaped consumers
  - config.yaml.j2:122: inline example comment in scoring.formula block
Both are informational-only; they contain no functional consumer-namespace code
path. Allowlisted per deviation Rule 2 (correct allowlist coverage so the test
does not produce false failures on main).
